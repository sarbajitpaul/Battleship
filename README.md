# Battleship
The oddly not so known Battleship game in an android app.

# Game Instructions
The game is based on the board game **Battleship**.  
Here you have three hidden ships, each taking 3 cells, which you have to sink by hitting them.  
Press the cells and if it turns **RED** then it's a **HIT**.  
If it turns **GREEN** then it's a **MISS**.  
You have to sink all the 3 ships and at the end you will be given with the `number of guesses` you took to sink them.

## Note
Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically.  
Use the **RESET** button if you wish to reset the game.
